# burger

This app is to see a list of burgers both available for purchased and already devoured. It also allows a user to add any additional burgers not yet listed (to either the devoured or hot & ready sections). 

This is a pretty basic app; however, it's definitely lacking a bit of functionality. The user isn't able to move the hot & ready burgers to those eaten. The code was written as such. Additionally, I'm the onclick event (to add burgers) is not sending data to the mysql database. It is pulling data from sql, but that's where the communication ends. Not sure what is going on with the disconnect, which is why there aren't buttons to move already added burgers around.
